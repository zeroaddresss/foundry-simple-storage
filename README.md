## About
This project is entry-level for getting familiar with Foundry and Solidity at the same time, specifically for beginners to understand the data structures in Solidity. From a logical standpoint, SimpleStorage is a straightforward smart contract that stores (storage) the preferences of each user interacting with our contract. Additionally, the implementation of this project addresses some of the fundamental concepts, including interaction between different smart contracts, inheritance, and deployment via Foundry.

## General

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
